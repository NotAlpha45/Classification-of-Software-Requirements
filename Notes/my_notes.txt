1) The irrelavant requirements dataset was taken from this -> https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9650315

2) Experiment 1 (Classifying the relevant and irrelavant requirements):

- I will need an NLP model for the classification
- Can I run a classifier model instead of the language processor layer to classify requirements?
